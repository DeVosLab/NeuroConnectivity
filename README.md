# NeuroConnectivity
ImageJ/Fiji macro set to quantify neuronal connectivity in images of iPSC derived- and primary neuronal cultures. This macro is derived from an AcapellaÂ® (PerkinElmer) script (https://github.com/VerschuurenM/NeuronalConnectivity). Cultures are immunochemically labeled for a nuclear marker, dendrite marker and a pre- and postsynaptic marker. After maximum projection of acquired z-stacks, nuclei are detected using a manually assigned threshold or by applying the trained convolution neural network Stardist. Neurites are identified using a rough (user-defined threshold) and fine (user-defined threshold after tubeness filtering) segmentation, which is a simplified version of MorphoNeuroNet. Next, the nuclei mask is subtracted from the neurite mask after which the neurite mask is dilated to obtain a search region in which the pre- and postsynaptic spots are detected. The spots are first enhanced using a gaussian, Laplacian or multi-scale Laplacian filter with a user-defined kernel size. Next, a user-defined threshold is applied to segment the spots. The resolution of the microscope setup does not allow determining the exact location of individual markers within a synapse, but this is not the intention of the assay. Instead, the lower resolution is exploited to define synapses as those objects that demonstrate an overlap of minimum 1 pixel between the pre- and postsynaptic spots. In addition to this object-based colocalization, the Pearson correlation of the pre- and postsynaptic channel is calculated in the search region as an intensity-based colocalization metric.
